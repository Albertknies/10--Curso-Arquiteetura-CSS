CSS Architecture Course - Alura
Welcome, everyone! I have completed the Alura CSS Architecture course and created this repository to share my experiences, notes, and source code with fellow students and web development enthusiasts. In this course, we are exploring various techniques and concepts for organizing and styling CSS to create amazing and responsive websites.

Course Sections
Layout Base and Header Styling
In the first section, we learned how to set up our environment and began working on the site's header. It is crucial to keep CSS selectors organized and simplified to avoid redundancy.
Banner and About Styling
In this section, we delved into styling the banner and the "About" section of the site. It was fascinating to learn about the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology to make our CSS more structured.
Recipe Styling
The third section focused on styling the site's recipes. It was great to see how to organize the CSS for the panel and keep everything well-structured.
Styling "About Us"
In this part, we explored styling the "About Us" section and learned best practices for working with images. Image referencing is an essential aspect.
Footer Styling and Site Responsiveness
In the final section, we worked on styling the footer and made the site responsive. Responsiveness is crucial to ensure a great user experience on different devices.
Next Steps
I plan to practice what I have learned in this course by applying CSS architecture techniques to real projects.
I am excited to share my progress in web development and help fellow students whenever possible.
